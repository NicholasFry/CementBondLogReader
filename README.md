# Cement Bond Log Reader

This is a python based cement bond log reader for .las files. This program uses lasio to load .las files from the same directory as the python script. The bond reader will visualize the bond logs AMP3FT and TT3FT values if you enter the command 'visualize'. The bond reader will annotate the bond log for the desired depths of concern if you enter the command 'annotate'. The bond reader can then save that annotated file and automatically generate a report with averages and standard deviations of the sonic amplitudes and travel times. The report is generated in the same directory as the python script under the file name 'output_report.pdf'

Enjoy.
